  <p> My name is Veronika.I'm a Reiki master,life coach,and holistic healing practitioner.
  <p> Reiki is a holistic healing technique that allows a therapist to channel energy into a patient by means of touch, or by holding their hands above them. The energy is channeled into a patient to aid the natural healing processes of a patientâ€™s body and restore physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well being.

Reiki has many benefits including the improvement of overall well being, stress management, revitalization and a stabling of energy. Reiki has been used as a healing practice since the end of the last century, but is massively growing in popularity today. A question many people have is how does one get into Reiki and what is involved?
There are three levels of Reiki that must be completed in order for a person to become a Reiki Master. These are the First Degree level, the Second Degree level, and the Master/Teacher, or Third Degree, level.</p>
<p>I offer private consultations,Reiki treatments and attunements,as well
as life coaching sessions.I am here to help you actualize your potential &#38;to motivate
you to be the best that you can be.Let's talk about manifesting your <em> new </em>life!
